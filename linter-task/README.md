# Linter

The following task is used to provide linter support for various languages:-

- `prettier` (An opinionated code format checker)
- `tslint` (TypeScript lint)
- `yamllint` (YAML linter)
- `mdlint` (Markdown linter)
- `shellcheck` (Bash linter)
- `kubeval` (Performs linter on Kubernetes manifests using `kubeval`) _Note_: Kubeval is used to validate one or more Kubernetes configuration files, and is often used locally as part of a development workflow as well as in CI pipelines.

## Installing the Task

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tektoncd/catalog/v1beta1/linter/linter.yaml
```

## Parameters

- **linter** : The linter which you want to apply on the cloned repository. Appected values are `prettier`, `tslint`, `yaml`, `md`, `shell`, `kubeval`
- **filepath** : The file path containing the files on which you want to apply the linter check

## Workspaces

- **file-workspace** : The workspace containing files on which we want to apply linter check. It can be a shared workspace with the `git-clone` task or a `ConfigMap` mounted containing some files

## Usage

This task uses [git-clone](https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog/blob/v1beta1/git/git-clone.yaml) task in the pipeline to clone the `git repository` in the workspace. 
In the task, we need to the provide the param `linter` which specifies the linter that needs to be applied in the cloned repository. Param `filepath` to provide the path of the files on which linter has to be applied. 

After we run the pipeline, we will get the logs for the linter performed that may include (depending on the type of linter used) suggestions to fix the lint issue. 

This [pipeline](../linter/example/run.yaml) can be referred to create a pipeline.


**NOTE**: Pipeline will go into `failed` state if the linter check fails.
